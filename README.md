    TextureForge is an open-source suite of texture tools that aims to streamline the texture workflow for 
    Game Developers and 3D Asset Creators. The goal of this project is to provide a collection of useful utilities 
    that automate, optimise and - where possible - eliminate tedious and repetitive texturing tasks.
